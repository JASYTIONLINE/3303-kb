### 4. Wrap-Up — Week 01 Summary  
**Theme:** The Foundations of Product Design  

**Core Takeaways**
- **Design = the rendering of intent.** Every decision expresses purpose.  
- **Design ≠ Art:** design solves problems for others; art expresses the self.  
- Norman’s principles define interaction clarity:  
  - *Affordances* → what actions are possible  
  - *Signifiers* → cues that indicate those actions  
  - *Constraints* → limits that prevent errors  
  - *Mapping* → control-to-effect relationships  
  - *Feedback* → system response confirming an action  
- Good design is invisible because it fits its user’s expectations and context.  
- Context determines success — designers must learn to zoom in on details and zoom out to see the user’s world.  

**You Practiced**
- Applying design vocabulary to everyday objects (*Bad Design in the Wild*).  
- Sketching ideas in a low-fidelity tool (Excalidraw).  
- Communicating insights using course terminology in discussion.

---
