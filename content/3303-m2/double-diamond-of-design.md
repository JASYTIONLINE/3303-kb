## Introduction
Week 2 focuses on moving from *what design is* to *how designers think.*  
The Double Diamond and the [Human-Centered Design (HCD) loop](content/3303-m2/human-centered-design-loop.md) work together to help you learn both structure and practice.  
The Double Diamond gives you a map for where you are in the design process, and the HCD loop tells you how to move within each phase.  
This page shows you how to use these tools to meet the **student learning objectives (SLOs)**, complete the **Figma for Beginners** exercise, and deliver the **Digital Product Analysis** assignment with purpose and precision.

## Connecting to SLOs
The SLOs for this week ask you to:
1. Describe the four phases of the Double Diamond (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver).  
2. Explain the iterative nature of the HCD process (Observe, Ideate, Prototype, Test).  
3. Demonstrate basic proficiency in Figma.  
4. Apply analytical vocabulary to critique a digital product.  

You can meet these by treating your assignments as a design lab.  
Every click, note, and screenshot can connect back to one or more of these objectives.  
When you observe users or analyze interfaces, you’re working in the **Discover** and **Observe** spaces.  
When you sketch ideas or test layouts in Figma, you’re practicing **Develop** and **Prototype**.  
By consciously linking your work to these steps, you turn routine assignments into demonstrations of learning outcomes.

---

## Applying to the Exercise
In the **Figma for Beginners** tutorial, you’re not just following directions—you’re building your first prototype inside a controlled learning loop.  
Treat the tutorial as your **Prototype** phase in the HCD loop and as your **Develop** stage in the Double Diamond.  
Pause after each section and ask: *What problem is this design element solving? What user behavior does this affordance encourage?*  
These quick reflections help you meet SLOs 1 and 2 by connecting actions in Figma to the logic of design thinking.  
Document your observations—screenshots, short notes, or annotations—to show that you understand the “why” behind each design choice.

---

## Applying to the Assignment
For the **Digital Product Analysis**, begin in the **Observe** phase.  
Look at the app or website as if you were the user.  
Identify strong and weak design elements using terms like affordance, constraint, signifier, and feedback.  
Then, **Ideate**—what would you change or test if you were the designer?  
You don’t need to redesign the app; you just need to show that you can think through it using the vocabulary and reasoning of a designer.  
By labeling your Figma frames clearly and placing your notes near the design elements, you’re demonstrating both **analysis** and **communication**, directly supporting SLOs 3 and 4.

---

## Using Double Diamond Principles
The Double Diamond helps you frame your work:  
- The **first diamond** (Discover → Define) aligns with analyzing your chosen product—identifying the problem and defining it clearly.  
- The **second diamond** (Develop → Deliver) mirrors your work in Figma—experimenting, refining, and producing a presentable file.  
Each pass through the HCD loop sits inside these diamonds.  
Observe and Ideate belong in Discover and Define, while Prototype and Test live in Develop and Deliver.  
When you approach your tasks this way, you’re not just completing assignments—you’re thinking like a designer who understands how theory informs practice.

---

## Reflecting on Learning
Before you submit, take a few minutes to reflect:  
- Which step of the HCD loop came most naturally?  
- Where did you get stuck?  
- How did the Double Diamond help you organize your thoughts or decisions?  
Writing a short paragraph of reflection helps solidify what you’ve learned and can serve as a quick note to reference in future projects.  
Design education isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about recognizing patterns in how you think and create.

---

## Conclusion
This week’s goal is to connect **process to practice.**  
By applying the HCD loop and Double Diamond principles, you’re meeting SLOs while learning how real designers solve problems.  
Use the loop to stay curious, use the Diamond to stay structured, and use Figma to turn thought into form.  
The more intentional you are about linking theory to action, the faster design will shift from something you study to something you *do.*
