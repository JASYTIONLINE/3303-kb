- [ ] FigJam tool demo submitted.  
- [ ] Project 1 completed and presented.  
- [ ] Quiz 1 submitted.  
### Module 2 / Week 2 — Mapping the Design Process

#### Intent
Transition from the **“what” of design** to the **“how.”**  
Students learn to navigate ambiguity using formal process models and begin building technical fluency in **Figma**.  

#### Reading Phase
1. *The Shape of a Design Process* — overview of the Double Diamond and HCD frameworks.  
2. Wang, A. (2020). *First Steps to Learning to Design,* Ch. 1 “Why You Don’t Need to Be an Artist to Be a Designer.”  
3. Design Council (2015). *The Double Diamond: A Universally Accepted Depiction of the Design Process.*  
4. Newman, D. (n.d.). *The Design Squiggle.*  
5. Stanford d.school (2016). *Design Project Guide.*

#### Learning Objectives
- Describe the four phases of the Double Diamond model (SLO-1).  
- Explain the iterative nature of Human-Centered Design (SLO-1).  
- Demonstrate basic Figma proficiency (SLO-4).  
- Apply design vocabulary to critique a digital product (SLO-1, SLO-5).

#### Exercises
**Exercise 01 – Figma for Beginners** (20 pts | Pass/Fail)  
Complete Figma’s official rapid tutorial series to design a simple portfolio site.  
- Submit a public “view only” link showing at least 70 % completion.  
- Emphasis on process comprehension, not polish.  
**Due:** Sun Oct 26 @ 11:59 PM CT.

#### Assignment
**Assignment 01 – Digital Product Analysis** (40 pts | Pass/Fail)  
Analyze a real digital product (app or website) using Figma.  
- Create a file named `LastName – 3303 – Assignment 01`.  
- Include 3–5 key screens (one per labeled frame).  
- Annotate with color-coded notes showing:  
  - Product goal + target audience  
  - 2 effective design examples  
  - 2 ineffective design examples  
  - ≥ 4 Week 01 terms (affordance, signifier, constraint, mapping, feedback)  
- Submit a public “view only” link.  
**Due:** Sun Oct 26 @ 11:59 PM CT.

#### ExCheck
- [ ] Double Diamond + HCD process understood  
- [ ] Figma tutorial completed (≥ 70 %)  
- [ ] Product analysis submitted and annotated  
- [ ] Week 02 readings and wrap-up reflected in discussion

#### Wrap-Up
Week 02 connected **design theory to digital practice.**  
Students can now articulate the shape of a design process and operate confidently inside Figma.

#### Looking Ahead to Week 03
Next week focuses on **“finding the right problem.”**  
You’ll explore **ideation techniques** and create your first **wireframes** for the term-long project (Assignment 02).

### Module 3 / Week 3 — Components & Layout Systems

#### Intent
Build **component-based design systems** in Figma. Learn how to scale layouts with consistency and accessibility.  

#### Reading Phase
1. View Module 3 Instructor Video + Objectives.  
2. View: *Atomic Design* (Brad Frost).  
3. Read: Material Design Guidelines: Components.  

#### Learning Objectives
- Create and manage component libraries.  
- Apply grid systems and responsive layouts.  
- Collaborate on team design systems.  

#### Deliverables
- Discussion Post + Response.  
- Individual Assignment 3: Component Creation in Figma.  
- **Project 3:** Team Component Library & Layout System.  
- Quiz 3.  

#### ExCheck
- [ ] Components created and functional.  
- [ ] Team library submitted.  
- [ ] Layout system validated.  
- [ ] Quiz 3 passed.

### Module 4 / Week 4 — Usability & Final Prototype

#### Intent
Finalize a complete product prototype, test usability, and present results. Reflect on design principles learned.  

#### Reading Phase
1. Read: *Strategies for Presenting Design Work*.  
2. Read: *Intro to Prototyping in Figma*.  
3. Optional: *Presenting Remotely*.
