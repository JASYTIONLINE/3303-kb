    {
      "keyword": "Human-Centered Design Loop",
      "definition": "An iterative design process that keeps people at the center by continuously observing their needs, generating ideas, creating prototypes, and testing solutions to refine usability and value.",
      "context": "In Week 2, the Human-Centered Design Loop is described as the repeating cycle of Observe, Ideate, Prototype, and Test—used to keep design grounded in human behavior and feedback."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Double Diamond of Design",
      "definition": "A visual model from the British Design Council showing the design process as two diamonds—one for finding the right problem and one for designing the right solution—each moving from divergence to convergence.",
      "context": "The Double Diamond of Design is introduced in Week 2 as a way to move from uncertainty to clarity, first exploring a problem space (Discover and Define), then creating and refining solutions (Develop and Deliver)."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Discover",
      "definition": "The first phase of the Double Diamond model, focused on open exploration, research, and understanding user needs before attempting to solve anything.",
      "context": "In the Discover phase, designers gather insights through observation and research to uncover what users truly need rather than jumping to conclusions about solutions."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Define",
      "definition": "The second phase of the Double Diamond, where designers analyze gathered information to identify patterns, clarify insights, and frame a clear problem statement.",
      "context": "Define follows Discover by narrowing broad observations into a specific problem to solve, ensuring that the design effort has a clear target before moving into development."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Develop",
      "definition": "The third phase of the Double Diamond, where designers ideate, experiment, and prototype multiple potential solutions to the defined problem.",
      "context": "In the Develop phase, creative exploration takes center stage—designers brainstorm and test different ideas to see which best meets the user’s needs."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Deliver",
      "definition": "The final phase of the Double Diamond, focused on refining, testing, and implementing the chosen solution until it is ready for real-world release.",
      "context": "During Deliver, designers evaluate prototypes through user testing, adjust based on feedback, and finalize the design for launch or presentation."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Affordance",
      "definition": "A property of an object or interface that suggests how it can be used, such as a button implying it should be clicked.",
      "context": "In user interface design, a raised button provides an affordance that tells users they can press it to perform an action."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Constraint",
      "definition": "A limitation or control built into a design that guides user behavior or prevents errors.",
      "context": "A grayed-out button that cannot be clicked until required fields are filled demonstrates a constraint that keeps the user on the correct path."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Signifier",
      "definition": "A visual or auditory cue that communicates what action is possible or how to interact with a design element.",
      "context": "An icon of a trash can serves as a signifier, indicating to the user that this is the location for deleting files or data."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Feedback",
      "definition": "A system’s visible or audible response to user input, confirming that an action has occurred or providing corrective information.",
      "context": "When a form submission triggers a confirmation message or animation, that visual cue is feedback letting the user know the action succeeded."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Analysis",
      "definition": "The process of breaking down observations or data to identify patterns, insights, and underlying problems that inform design direction.",
      "context": "In Week 2, analysis is part of defining the problem space—designers interpret their research to decide what issue is most worth solving."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Observe",
      "definition": "The first step in the Human-Centered Design loop, where designers watch users in context to understand their behaviors, pain points, and motivations.",
      "context": "Observation allows designers to move beyond assumptions and uncover genuine user needs through real-world evidence."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Ideate",
      "definition": "The creative stage of the Human-Centered Design loop focused on generating a wide range of possible solutions to a defined problem.",
      "context": "During ideation, designers brainstorm freely, exploring as many potential ideas as possible before selecting those to prototype."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Prototype",
      "definition": "A simplified version or model of a design used to explore, test, and validate ideas before final production.",
      "context": "Prototyping helps designers visualize solutions early, allowing them to test functionality and user reactions with minimal investment."
    },
    {
      "keyword": "Test",
      "definition": "The stage where prototypes or products are evaluated by users to gather feedback and insights that drive refinement and improvement.",
      "context": "In testing, designers observe users interacting with the design to see what works, what fails, and how the solution can evolve to better meet real needs."
